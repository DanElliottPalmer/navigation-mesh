#navigation mesh

hi.

this stuff i wrote as a starting point for a navigation mesh. there's most definately places it can be optimized which i might get round to doing at some point but treat this as a starting point if you are considering using it.

i've left all the debug console logs in for simplifying that path so you can have a look at that if you want.

the renderer and shape stuff is something i wrote quickly so i can debug so again, it could probably do with optimizing if you're thinking of using it.

honestly, i would more look at this as a guide for how a navigation mesh might work.

also i'm pretty crappy at writing readmes.
